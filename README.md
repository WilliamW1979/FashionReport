# Fashion Report

This plugin will Calculate your points based on what you are currently wearing to to you what your score will be. Scoring is based on a simple system that Scarlet Luna@Exodus discovered. Looking around the internet, no one else seemed to fully understand the system and had only a basic understanding of the system so as far as I know, she is the first person to get the scoring of Fashion Report 100% accurate.

Your Weapon and Armor slots are worth 10 points each.
Your Accessory slots are worth 8 points each.
You will get 0 points in a slot for not wearing something.
You will get max points in a slot that isn't themed wearing something.
You will get max points if you wear a themed item. (Gold Coin Symbol)
You will only get 2 points if you wear something and it doesn't match the theme. (Gray participation stamp)

Dyes are BONUS POINTS and are worth 1 point right colot, 2 points right shade.

Based on this system system, it is very simple to know what your points will be prior to judging if you know the themed slots in advance. Luckily we know most of them thanks to the historical records from pervious weeks (links will be below) . Most of her data came from the reddit group that does dyes to the fashion report every Friday morning, though she did want me to give respect to Meoni because his videos were able to correct the tons of mistakes that were made by the reddit group without spending hours combing through reddit pages to figure out what they were trying to say. (Typoes, completely wrong information sometimes, etc...).

A website dedicated to this information will soon be going up, but I have nothing to do with it. The woman who wormed on me with this project and gathered all the data for it will be the one hosting it. I will link it here when it is ready since she is the reason we have this mod and it will use the same data.

Basically, just replace all references to `SamplePlugin` in all of the files and filenames with your desired name, then start building the plugin of your dreams. You'll figure it out üòÅ
