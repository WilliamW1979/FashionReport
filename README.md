# Fashion Report

This plugin will Calculate your points based on what you are currently wearing to to you what your score will be. Scoring is based on a simple system that <b>[Scarlet Luna@Exodus](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/42275509/)</b> discovered. Looking around the internet, no one else seemed to fully understand the system and had only a basic understanding of the system so as far as I know, she is the first person to be able to explain in detail the point system. She took the time to experiment with it and understand how it works. She shared that information with me and I used it to make this. Most of this MOD is based off her work which you can see from her Google Sheets.

Basically, just replace all references to `SamplePlugin` in all of the files and filenames with your desired name, then start building the plugin of your dreams. You'll figure it out 😁

>- Your slots are worth specific points each.
>    - Your Weapon slot is worth 10 points.
>    - Your Armor slots are worth 10 points.
>    - Your Accessory slots are worth 8 points.
>- You will get 0 points if a slot is empty.
>- You will get 2 points in a themed slot for wearing something not matching the theme. (Gray participation stamp)
>- You will get max points in a slot that isn't themed wearing anything or matching the slot theme. (Gold stamp for matched theme)

* Dyes are BONUS POINTS
  - 1 point - Wrong shade but right color.
  - 2 points - Right shade.
* Only your weapon slot and your armor slots have bonus dye chances, accessories do not.

All the slots combine to a total of 100 points with dyes being bonus points, though you can't go over 100 when judged. This system along with what will give us points based on the theme history, lets us know in advance what our point total will be. Using this information, I threw together a window to calculate this in real time so switching out your gear will update it.

A website dedicated to this information will soon be going up, but I have nothing to do with it. Scarlet will be the one hosting it and I mention it because it was her hard work that made this MOD possible (I refuse to steal credit from her, she is the brains behind this). When that website is available, I will link it here to give her respect for her work.
